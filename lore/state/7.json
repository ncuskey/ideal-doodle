  "summary": "Bhiagab is a coastal state of Southia in the Westford Era (1291), ruled from the inland capital Stroila and economically tied to the seaport of Moggbig. Four rivers knit its interior to the coast, and two ports handle maritime traffic, supported by a small fleet. A Kobblin-majority society with a significant Durinn minority, Bhiagab fields cavalry-heavy regiments and manages cautious relations with three neighboring states (IDs 12, 14, 15).",
  "history": [
    "Rise of Stroila as the political seat consolidated Bhiagab’s interior communities under a single administration, lending its name and leadership to multiple regiments.",
    "Moggbig’s harbor expanded into the realm’s principal maritime outlet, later joined by a smaller secondary port to handle local cabotage.",
    "Border frictions with neighboring states (12, 14, 15) led to the development of a mobile, cavalry-forward army to patrol open country and river crossings.",
    "The state established river wardens and toll regimes along its four rivers to finance roads and coastal defenses.",
    "A small fleet was organized to deter piracy and escort merchants between Bhiagab’s two ports.",
    "By Westford Era 1291, the court focuses on securing river mouths, improving port customs, and balancing Kobblinist and Durinn religious interests in major burgs."

  "geographyNotes": "Bhiagab fronts the sea with an accessible coastline and two ports; Moggbig serves as the main deepwater facility, with a smaller harbor elsewhere on the coast. Four rivers traverse the state, shaping travel corridors from the interior to the shore and creating river-valley settlements near bridges and fords. Biome distribution is dominated by biome#5 with minor patches of biome#6 and biome#7. The coastal influence moderates temperatures, and much of the interior remains open enough to favor mounted travel and rapid troop movement.",
  "societyNotes": "The Kobblin culture and Kobblinism are predominant (about 60%), with a substantial Durinn presence (around 20%) adhering to the Durinn Faith; other groups exist but are less numerous. Civic life centers on burgs—especially Stroila and Moggbig—where faiths coexist through practical arrangements over festivals, markets, and guild charters. Military service emphasizes horsemanship, and local identities often organize around burg wards, river parishes, and port guilds rather than strict clan lines.",
  "economyNotes": "Trade flows downriver to the coast, concentrating on the Stroila–Moggbig axis. Moggbig handles most seagoing commerce; a smaller port supports short-haul traffic and fishing, while inland towns like Kleabsil, Zarag, and Bratzakt anchor craftwork and provisioning. With no formal route hubs designated, caravans and river barges use well-traveled roads and landings. Revenue comes from port customs, river tolls, and remount breeding that sustains the state’s cavalry arm.",
