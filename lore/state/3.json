  "summary": "Zataphruz is a coastal Aj'Snaga-led state of Southia centered on the port-capital Itheshruz. Nineteen rivers knit interior market towns—Ki'jiress, Nasar, and Akkuss—to the sea via Itheshruz and the secondary port of Oz'jash. Archery-heavy regiments and small patrol fleets guard estuaries and river mouths. In Westford Era 1291, Zataphruz balances spirit-led traditions with Kobblin minority communities and pragmatic maritime trade.",
  "history": [
    "River clans consolidated around the Itheshruz estuary, organizing shared use of channels and floodplains under Aj'Snaga spirit pacts.",
    "Provincial identities coalesced (Nasar, Xas'tu, Ki'jiress, Mapjar), later providing names and recruiting grounds for the regimental system.",
    "Growth of Ki'jiress and Nasar as inland suppliers strengthened the capital's position; Kobblin artisans and traders established quarters in the ports.",
    "Two seaports (Itheshruz and Oz'jash) were formalized, with modest fleets raised to deter estuary predation and escort traffic.",
    "By Westford Era 1291, borders with two neighboring states are managed largely along waterways, while regiments rotate to secure key fords and mouths."
  ],
  "geographyNotes": "Sea frontage with estuaries and brackish wetlands; 19 river courses provide inland navigation and seasonal floodplains. Dominant biomes: biome#7 (primary), biome#12 (secondary), and biome#5 (localized patches). Coastal influence moderates temperatures; wet seasons swell the rivers and bring fogs over backwaters. Notable districts echo regimental names: Nasar, Xas'tu, Ki'jiress, and Mapjar. Estuaries are patrolled by small fleets based at Itheshruz and Oz'jash.",
  "societyNotes": "Aj'Snaga culture and the Aj'Snaga Spirits faith shape public rites and local arbitration through spirit lodges. Kobblin communities (following Kobblinism) concentrate in ports and market streets, contributing to trade and crafts. Archery is a celebrated civic duty, with festivals doubling as musters. Provincial loyalties—Nasar, Xas'tu, Ki'jiress, Mapjar—inform recruitment, patronage, and identity.",
  "economyNotes": "Commerce moves by water; there are no major overland route hubs. Two ports anchor maritime trade: Itheshruz (capital, main harbor) and Oz'jash (secondary). Inland towns—Ki'jiress, Nasar, Akkuss—funnel riverborne produce and crafts to the coast. Harbor dues and river tolls fund patrols and fleets. Bowyery and fletching are notable crafts, supplying the state’s archer-heavy regiments.",
