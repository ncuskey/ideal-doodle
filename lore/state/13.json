  "summary": "Rilorbaria is a coastal state of Southia centered on the port-capital Boumaberg. In the Westford Era year 1291 it controls five sea ports and a web of ten rivers that bind its interior to the coast. A Keltan-majority society guided mainly by the Chordenver Faith, it also hosts Autliardist congregations and a notable secular segment. Four named regiments and a small fleet secure the shoreline, river mouths, and borders with four neighboring states.",
  "history": [
    "Boumaberg grows from a coastal market into the state’s capital and primier harbor.",
    "The Chordenver Faith becomes the principal creed among Keltan communities; Autliardism establishes a foothold in several towns.",
    "River piers and breakwaters are built along the coast, culminating in five functioning ports; Invers rises as the secondary port.",
    "Rilorbaria organizes its standing forces into named regiments: 1st (Chearcy), 2nd (Fermaw), 3rd (Boumaberg), and 4th (Akereskcalia).",
    "A modest 1st Fleet is commissioned to deter piracy and escort coastal trade.",
    "By W.E. 1291, the state balances maritime commerce, multi-faith urban life, and frontier defense along borders with four neighbors."
  ],
  "geographyNotes": "Coastal state on Southia with accessible harbors and ten rivers that enable inland navigation and irrigation. Dominant biomes are biome#8 (most common), with significant patches of biome#6 and smaller areas of biome#1, producing varied terrain and land use across lowlands and uplands. The coast and river valleys concentrate settlement, while interior tracts of the secondary biomes remain less densely developed.",
  "societyNotes": "Keltan culture predominates, with Uruk and Wildlands communities present in towns and along frontiers. Religious life is led by the Chordenver Faith, alongside active Autliardism congregations and a meaningful secular cohort. Urban parishes and mercantile guilds in Boumaberg and Invers shape civic policy, while rural districts look to regimental garrisons and local clergy for order and mediation.",
  "economyNotes": "Five ports support sea trade; Boumaberg (largest) and Invers are the principal maritime outlets. Key inland towns—Gerunos, Matenvers, and Inveram—link river traffic to coastal markets. No formal route hubs are recorded, so roads and rivers serve as flexible corridors for cartage. The 1st Fleet provides convoy and patrol duties; regimental garrisons secure river crossings and customs points. Commerce concentrates in Boumaberg’s quays and the warehouses of Invers.",
